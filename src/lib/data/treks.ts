      "The Kheerganga Trek is one of the most popular beginner treks in Himachal Pradesh, winding through the breathtaking Parvati Valley from the village of Barshaini. The 12–13 km trail passes through dense pine forests, wooden bridges, ancient villages, and the thundering Rudra Nag waterfall before reaching the natural hot springs of Parvati Kund at 9,711 ft.\n\nKheerganga is named after the milky-white sacred water of its hot spring, believed since ancient times to be blessed by Lord Shiva. The views of the Parvati River and surrounding snow-capped peaks are spectacular throughout. At the top, soak in the geothermal Parvati Kund pool and camp under one of the most star-filled skies in the Western Himalayas. An ideal first Himalayan trek for backpackers and adventure seekers.",

      "The Beas Kund Trek leads to the sacred glacial lake that is the source of the River Beas, one of the great rivers of north India. Nestled at 12,139 ft (3,700 m) in the Solang Valley near Manali, the lake sits at the foot of towering peaks including Friendship Peak (17,352 ft) and Hanuman Tibba (19,750 ft) — some of the most impressive mountain walls in the Western Himalayas.\n\nThis short, beginner-friendly trek through the lush Bakarthach meadows is ideal as a first or second Himalayan trek. The approach follows the Beas River upstream through open valleys of extraordinary scenic beauty, accessible even to trekkers with limited experience. A deeply spiritual place and a visual feast in equal measure.",
